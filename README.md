# A-Star-Visualiser

## :zap: About
A* (pronounced A-star) is a fascinating approach used to search mazes for the best, or most omptimal path. This is a tool I made to visualise the A* algorithm. 

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
Just clone the repository on your machine, and run `main.py`. You might need to install a few packages, like `pygame`.

## :grey_question: Controls
- First, mark the start and end points. 
- Then, draw as many (or as few) walls as you want.
- Press `<SPACE>` to search for the best path.
- Press `c` to clear the maze.
- If you want to use a bigger or smaller base grid, just change `CELL_SIZE` in the source code.
- If you want to change the colours or mess with the time settings, just change the values in the source code (it is super easy to understand)!
